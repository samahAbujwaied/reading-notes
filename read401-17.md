# How do cloud providers compute service costs?
**When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud**

|Server Instances|A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based|
|Containers|Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop.|
|Cloud Services|Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. ... Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity or virtual private network (VPN)|
|Cloud Architecture|Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include: A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud) ... A cloud-based delivery model|
|AWS|As the lead cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the primary profit driver for Amazon. AWS provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security. AWS accounts for about 13% of Amazon's total revenue as of Q2 2021.|
|EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku|We deploy a web application to Heroku and to AWS Elastic Beanstalk in production configurations; contrasting their implementations and pricing. note: This is not to say that AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the only comparable way to run workloads in AWS; it, however, is the one that most closely resembles Heroku|
