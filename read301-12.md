| SQL|             NoSQL            |
| -----------|------------------------------|
| databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS    |  NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.     |
| databases are table based databases     | atabases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
|databases have predefined schema  |databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|  databases are vertically scalable |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
| databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.  |queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.      |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
**SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage**
**SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment**

## Give a real world example.
**Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application**

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
**databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.**
