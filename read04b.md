MAY-LI said " computers are everywhere they are in people's pokets they are in people's cars , but **what makes a computer a computer and How does'nt even work** ".

NAT said " **What does a computer a computer anyway** , as humans we have always bulit tools to help us solve problem tools  ".

*Explored how to design a thinking machine they relized that it had to perform four different tasks it would need to take input store information process it and then output the results now.*

#### History of computer

*The earlist computer were made out of wood and metal with machanical and gears by the 20th century though computers started using electrical componants these , early computers were raelly large and realy slow ,a computer the size of room might take hours just to do basic math problem.*

NAT said "modern computers look nothing like those clunky old machinebut they still do these some four things."

LIMOR said " computersword on ones & zeroes but actully today almost nobody deals directly with ones & zeroes but ones & zeroes do play a big role in **How computer work** if we have a single can either be on or off thatsa lot of choices but it's raelly important start with one wire we can represent a yes or no true or false or 1 or 0 ."

FEDERICO said " At inside computers are electric wire & circits that array all the information in a computer."

# Finally, I would like to extend my greetings to the Code.org team for providing us with this important information and their sequence of arrangement in explaining how a computer became a computer.
