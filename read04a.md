# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/19118/1*2xsLeLNqKwIoGOQlw8O6Ug.png)

### *First, we must explain each one separately*

* <Html>

> It is a markup language for creating web pages and web applications, and stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Use with CSS and JavaScript to create interactive web pages.

>> CONTENT LAYER
**.html files**
This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.


** **

* {css}
> CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheet - is a descriptive language that gives your website its beautiful look and unique design that will distinguish it from other websites.

>> PRESENTATION LAYER
**.css files**
The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

| each of LAYER |             explan           |
| -----------|------------------------------|
|  HTML  | It works on all devices and can be downloaded very quickly on slow connections      |
|  HTML+CSS     | It is saved in a separate page that can be linked with the HTML same style sheet, which will help protect it faster and easier for downloading.         |
|  HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIP     | Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).         |

## *PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE*

**You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).**

Basic JAVA instruction 

* ST A TEMENTS A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.


Statements should end with a semicolon.
* COMMENTS (use  //  for inline commint or /*   */ for paragragh)

 *JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword*
