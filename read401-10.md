**In its most common use, analogy has to do with comparison of things based on those things being alike in some way. For example, one can make or draw an analogy between the seasons of the year and the stages of life.**

**An analogy is saying something is like something else to make some sort of explanatory point. For example, “Life is like a box of chocolates—you never know what you're gonna get.” You can use metaphors and similes when creating an analogy**

**Argument from analogy is a special type of inductive argument, whereby perceived similarities are used as a basis to infer some further similarity that has yet to be observed. Analogical reasoning is one of the most common methods by which human beings attempt to understand the world and make decisions**

**Though there is no limit to the possibilities when it comes to word analogies, here are some examples to familiarize yourself with the concept: hammer : nail :: comb : hair. white : black :: up : down. mansion : shack :: yacht : dinghy.**

**An analogy is a comparison — usually either a metaphor or a simile — that helps to explain something or make it clearer. Analogical things use analogies or refer to them. A comparison like "You are quiet as a mouse" or "My brother was a pig at dinner" is analogical. The Greek root is analogos, "proportionate."**

# Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them

**Some of the most compelling stories we tell as human beings are not about humans at all. For most of human history, people have told stories in which animals or inanimate objects act in human-like ways. The term for this is anthropomorphism. As a writer or storyteller, understanding and using anthropomorphism in your work can open up a whole new world of fantastical characters and settings for you to explore.**

# Build a map of the information

**Analogy maps help you make sense of how the model relates to the concept you are studying. An analogy is a comparison between two things, usually to help explain an idea. In an analogy map, you describe (1) each part or feature of the model or the analogy and (2) the part of the science concept that it represents.**
