**A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. ... This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out**

**A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front**

**Use a queue when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in. Use a stack when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in. Use a list when you want to get anything out, regardless of when you put them in (and when you don't want them to automatically be removed)**

**A stack is an ordered list of elements where all insertions and deletions are made at the same end, whereas a queue is exactly the opposite of a stack which is open at both the ends meaning one end is used to insert data while the other to remove data**
