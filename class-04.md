### Writing Links
Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything between the opening a tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## What is Directory structure
**The directory structure is the organization of files into a hierarchy of folders. It should be stable and scalable; it should not fundamentally change, only be added to. Computers have used the folder metaphor for decades as a way to help users keep track of where something can be found.**

### Relative URLs
**Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.**

* Controlling the position of elements
* Creating site layouts

### Key Concepts in positioning eLements
#### * Building Blocks
*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*

### containing elements
 
 *If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.*

 ### Controlling the position of elements
 *CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.*

 * normal flow
 * relative Positioning
 * absolute Positioning

 *To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)*

 * fixed Positioning
 * floating elements
