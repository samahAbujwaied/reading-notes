# White space 

In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.

# line breaks& horizontal rules

* ```<br />```
As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag .
* ```<hr />```
To create a break between themes ‚Äî such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play ‚Äî you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the hr tag.

A CSS rule contains two parts:
* a selector .
* a declaration .

# CSS properties affect how eLements are displayed
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts:
