##  How the web works


**When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server**

**What is HTML ?**
     HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. 
#### HtmL uses eLements to describe the structure of pages

Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag

   They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

##### comment in HTML : 
```
<!-- between this tag  can you write the comment to paragraph -->
```
```
// for inline comment
```
**What is CSS?**

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

## Why people visit your Website 
**Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.**

## What your visitors are trying to achieve
**It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.**

## What information your visitors need
**You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.**

## hoW often people will visit your site
**Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.**

### site maps
**Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.**

**What is JS (JAVASCRIPT)?**

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages â€” every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at â€” displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

# Writing a script 

![](https://bootstrapstudio.io/assets/img/tutorials/writing-js/javascript%20editor.png)

**To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.**

**Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.**

1. DEFINE THE GOAL.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT.
3. CODE EACH STEP.
