### Use an analogy
**We can access previous and next url searched in web browser by pressing back and next button since, they are linked as linked list.**

### Explain a detail in depth
**In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.**

### Why do we use structure in linked list?
**Structure in linked list is used to store data of the node as well as the pointer to the next node's address. A linked list is a linear collection of similar data where the next node is reached using the previous node in list.**

### What is the use of structure in linked list?
**In C programming, we use structures to create a linked list. The structure is a data type inside which we can define variables with different data types (e.g., int , char , pointer , etc.)**

### How structure is used in linked list?
1. Insert node at the beginning.
2. Insert node in the middle
3. Insert node at the end
