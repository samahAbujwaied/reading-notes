## What Is Node.js?

##  what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
**Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.**
**Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.**

**The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.**

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
**when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.**

- This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## What is npm?
**a package manager that comes bundled with Node.**

## What version of node are you running on your machine?
**v12.22.1**

## What version of npm are you running on your machine?
**7.18.1**

## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
**```npm install -g jshint```**

## What is node used for?
**Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.**

6. Work environment readiness

# In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
**In my opinion I see if we learning from fellow students we will development quickly , because may sharing our experians together that allow us to find ourselves.

**Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.**
