**The Authorization and Proxy-Authorization request headers contain the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a (proxy) server. Here, the <type> is needed again followed by the credentials, which can be encoded or encrypted depending on which authentication scheme is used**

# What is safe to put into a JWT

**A JWT needs to be stored in a safe place inside the user's browser. ... To keep them secure, you should always store JWTs inside an httpOnly cookie. This is a special kind of cookie that's only sent in HTTP requests to the server. It's never accessible (both for reading or writing) from JavaScript running in the browser.**

## How are JWTs validated

**Check signature. The last segment of a JWT is the signature, which is used to verify that the token was signed by the sender and not altered in any way. The Signature is created using the Header and Payload segments, a signing algorithm, and a secret or public key (depending on the chosen signing algorithm)**
