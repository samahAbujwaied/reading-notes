# The growth mindset

is related to the mental capabilities that are based on how to become **a successful person** and all obstacles disappear, and even make these obstacles a reason to achieve your ***goals*** by using them to make them a step for success, you can simplify the large and complex matters to smaller topics to deal with easily

It is related also to how you search for positivity in *your life*, how to become a high-minded person. Certainly, you should not waste your time comparing yourself to people who have achieved success because they have gone through many stages 
>to achieve what they want to reach.
