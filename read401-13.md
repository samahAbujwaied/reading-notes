# Message Queues
![](https://www.cloudamqp.com/img/blog/thumb-mq.jpg)

**A message queue is a queue of messages sent between applications. It includes a sequence of work objects that are waiting to be processed. ... Another application, called a consumer, connects to the queue and gets the messages to be processed. Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the consumer retrieves them.**

**Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange, WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.**

**Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js**

# What happens if a client “misses” an event

**SignalR will buffer at least the last 1000 messages sent to a given connectionId. This means that when you send the 1251st message, the first 250 get dereferenced by the buffer. This explains why when a client first connects to the server, it receives the entire sequence of messages. You have to send at least 1251 messages to a given client before the buffer will drop fragments. Again, this is all assuming default settings.**

| Term       |       Definition             |
| -----------|------------------------------|
|Socket|A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints|
|Web Socket|The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply|
|Socket.io|Socket.IO allows bi-directional communication between client and server. Bi-directional communications are enabled when a client has Socket.IO in the browser, and a server has also integrated the Socket.IO package. ... Engine.IO is used for the server implementation and Engine. IO-client is used for the client|
|Client|noun. a person or group that uses the professional advice or services of a lawyer, accountant, advertising agency, architect, etc. a person who is receiving the benefits, services, etc., of a social welfare agency, a government bureau, etc. a customer. anyone under the patronage of another; a dependent.|
|Server|A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. ... An individual system can provide resources and use them from another system at the same time. This means that a device could be both a server and a client at the same time|
|OSI Model|The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software|
|TCP Model|The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer. ... TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality|
|TCP|TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks|
|UDP|UDP is commonly used for applications that are “lossy” (can handle some packet loss), such as streaming audio and video. It is also used for query-response applications, such as DNS queries
|Packets|In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. ... *A network is a group of two or more connected computers|
