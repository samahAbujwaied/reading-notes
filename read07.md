## CSS associates style rules with HTML elements

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**.

* **what is selector ?** 
 indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.

 * **what is declaration ?** 
  indicate how
the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

The elements displayed in css : you can declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: **a property** and  **a value**

* **what is properties ?**
 indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.

* **what is values ?**
specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.
